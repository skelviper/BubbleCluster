# BubbleCluster
Cluster single cell Hi-C data in a more accuracy manner.

## Background

There has been a rapid increase in the development of single-cell sequencing technology recently, methods of clustering single cell based on transcriptome, methylome and chromatin accessibility have identify lots of different cell types. But unbiased and high accuracy algorithms for clustering single-cell based on chromatin 3D structure are still limited and currently no easy-to-use software packages for this purpose.

Here we present a modified  method based on scHiCluster which have better performance and more biologically meaningful.
